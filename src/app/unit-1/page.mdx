   - Familiarize yourself with the layout and tools available in Scratch.
   - Demonstration of dragging and dropping code blocks.

2. **Building Your Game:**

   - Start by selecting a backdrop and characters (sprites) for your game.
   - Use motion blocks to make characters move.
   - Introduce loops for repeated actions and if-statements for decision making.
   - Add sounds and scores for interactivity.

3. **Customizing Your Game:**

   - Encourage creativity: change characters, add levels, or new challenges.
   - Tips on making games engaging and fun.

4. **Game Presentation:**
   - Share your game with classmates.
   - Discussion on the learning experience and problem-solving.

## Lesson 1.2: Installing and Exploring Codespaces

Next, we'll introduce Codespaces, a powerful tool for coding.

### Introduction to Codespaces

- **Objective:** Get comfortable with a professional code editor.
- **Activity:** Create an account with Github and Codespaces.
- **Materials:** Computers with internet access.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Making a Github Account:**

   - Visit [Github.com](https://github.com/).
   - Enter your school email and click Sign up.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to create an account.

2. **Accessing Codespaces:**

   - Visit [The Codespaces website](https://github.com/features/codespaces).
   - Click get started, and follow the on-screen instructions to log in using your Github account.

3. **Discovering Codespaces:**

   - Click New Codespace. Then, click select a repository.
   - Clone [this repo](https://github.com/soumyajit4419/Portfolio) by entering _soumyajit4419/Portfolio_. Click create Codespace.
   - Explore the interface: Learn about the sidebar, editor window, and status bar.

4. **Your First Code:**
   - Go to the terminal at the bottom of the screen.
   - Read the README file for instructions to set up the website.
   - In your terminal, type **npm install** and **npm start** to start your live site.
   - Run the program and see your live website by clicking the link on screen.

## Homework: Follow Unit 1.2 and Start Brainstorming

Before moving on, make sure to follow the instructions in Unit 1.2.
Make sure to start brainstorming now, so by the time we check in next time you have an idea all ready to go.

1. **Choose a Theme:**

   - Think about topics that interest you. This could be related to hobbies, school subjects, favorite books or movies, or even everyday problems you'd like to solve.

2. **Brainstorm Chatbot Functions:**

   - Consider what you want your chatbot to do. Here are some ideas to get you started:
   - Provide information about a specific topic.
   - Help with homework questions.
   - Recommend books, movies, or games.
   - Offer daily reminders or motivational messages.
   - Assist with organizing tasks or schedules.
   - Play games or quizzes.
   - Tell jokes or share fun facts.

3. **Define Your Chatbot's Personality:**

   - Think about the character of your chatbot. Is it friendly and casual? Professional and informative? Silly and playful? This will influence how users interact with it.

4. **Examples:**
   - Video Game Helper (Minecraft, Fortnite, Roblox)
   - Messi or Ronaldo Soccer Coach
   - Taylor Swift Lyric Maker
   - Tik Tok Idea Generator
   - Gordon Ramsay Recipe Maker
   - Clash Royale Deck Generator

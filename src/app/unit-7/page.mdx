## **Lesson 7.1: Designing AI Websites**

In this lesson, students will create a mockup of what their AI website will look like.

### What is a Mockup?

Mockups are drawings of final products. They help make development a smooth and organized process.

### How do I make a Mockup?

- Open Google Draw or take out a piece of paper and just draw your website!
- Draw lines connecting screens.
- Take notes on the functionality of each screen/component.
- Check out some well-established websites like apple.com and amazon.com for inspiration.

### Example Mockups:

- [Google Draw Example](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1C9o11ImSda-dNcFT_bFodEjmMyLN_VUa15L4Y06Rs3E/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Hand-Drawn Example 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_WuUI9O-AiGCvV6YOs1-ev2ZAJZmoEel/view?usp=sharing)

## **Lesson 7.2: Coding Designs with Advanced Styling**

In this lesson, students will develop a front end for their AI Websites.

### Adding a Hero Section

Hero Sections are the attention-grabbing landing screens for websites.

- Open [HyperUI](https://www.hyperui.dev/) and find ‚ÄúBanners‚Äù.
- Find a component you like and press the ‚ÄúüëÄView‚Äù button. This reveals the code for the component.
- Open your Code Sandbox from unit 6 and create a new component named `HeroSection`.
- Open this [GitHub link](https://github.com/ArjunBakhale/nivaroStarterCode), click Code, and Codepaces to re-open your old Codespace.
- Add the Hero Section code to the component.
- Import and call `HeroSection` inside the starting page.

### Other Open Source Component Library Links:

These websites serve similar purposes as HyperUI. Using all these resources, most of your styling needs will be met.

- [HyperUI](https://www.hyperui.dev/)
- [Tailwind Components](https://tailwindcomponents.com/)
- [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/blocks/)
- [Tailgrids](https://tailgrids.com/components)
- [Chatbot alternative](https://tailwindcomponents.com/component/ai-chatbot)
